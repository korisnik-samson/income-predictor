# income-predictor
An A.I model, coded in pure Python using Jupyter.

The model basically predicts if a person will make less or more than $50,000 in a year based on various factors

This project makes this possible by utilising a dataset from Kaggle and UCI, which can also be found in the project

### Links to the dataset
